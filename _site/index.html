<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p><a id="about-me"></a>
Hi, I’m Aure (Aureliano Guedes), and my mission is to demystify the world of math and programming for everyone. My journey began with a fascination for science and technology, sparked by a childhood curiosity that led me to earn money by helping people solve minor computer issues. This hands-on experience laid the foundation for my passion for problem-solving and data-driven insights.</p>

<p>At 17yo, I began a degree in Biomedical Science, and by late 2007, I was working as a Data Engineer, diving into ETL processes for biomedical data. This role deepened my passion for using data to drive meaningful societal change. In 2016, I pursued a Master’s degree in Math and Statistics at the University of São Paulo (USP), specializing in bioinformatics and machine learning. My work involved creating computational environments that made data and predictive models accessible to biologists, significantly enhancing their research outcomes.</p>

<p>Transitioning to the insurance industry, I developed predictive models that significantly reduced churn rates by anticipating customer behavior and assessing business risks. Later, in the energy sector, I led a project with a globally renowned company, developing a model to enhance and automate decision-making in delinquency management. This initiative aimed to optimize ROI under specific OPEX constraints, resulting in more effective strategies for managing overdue invoices.</p>

<p>These diverse experiences have convinced me that knowledge is best shared. That’s why I created this blog—to provide clear, actionable insights and examples that make data science and engineering approachable and practical. My goal is to show you that math and programming can be straightforward and immensely rewarding.</p>

<p>Given that we’re on GitHub, I assume you have at least a basic background to follow the posts. My aim is to help you understand how to achieve specific tasks and how to leverage data technology to solve business problems.</p>

<p>Dive into the content, and let’s make the worlds of math and programming not just accessible but also a powerful tool for your success.</p>

<h1 id="future">Future</h1>
<p><a id="future"></a>
In the near future, I plan to create posts that will be useful even to non-technical people.</p>
